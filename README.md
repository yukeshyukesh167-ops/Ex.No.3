### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 1 with Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting and Preceding Question Prompting  

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Define the Scenario and Use Case:
Scenario:
The manufacturing industry is looking to reduce manual monitoring and increase efficiency through automation. The system will utilize IoT devices and embedded controllers to automate equipment, monitor performance, and enable predictive maintenance. The goal is to streamline the production process, minimize downtime, and enhance energy efficiency.
Target Audience:
Manufacturing companies, specifically in sectors like automotive, electronics, and food processing, where automation can significantly improve productivity.


Main Objectives:

•	Improve production efficiency by 30%.
•	Minimize machinery downtime with predictive maintenance.
•	Enable real-time monitoring and remote control of manufacturing systems.
•	Reduce energy consumption by optimizing processes.
 
2.	Identify Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
Idea Generation Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What features can be incorporated into the automation system to optimize production and reduce downtime?” Generated Ideas:
•	Sensors for real-time monitoring of equipment performance.
•	Predictive maintenance alerts to anticipate equipment failures.
•	Energy usage optimization by automating the switching of machines on/off based on demand.
•	Cloud-based dashboards for remote monitoring and control of machinery.

Persona and Context Prompts:

•	Prompt: “What should the user interface and control system convey to the operators and managers?” Generated Context:
•	The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine performance, energy usage, and alerts.
•	The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training required for operators.

### Conclusion
Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.




# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
